<h1>My First Week of Code</h1>

This week has been an emotional rollercoaster. I felt like I started off on the same plane as everyone else, but the third day left me feeling like I had been left in the dust. This was needed realization for me: this is not going to be easy, and I am going to have to devote additional hours to be excel during bootcamp. My foundation is week, but I will strengthen it. Syntax is something that I will have to develop. 

<h1>What I learned my first week at camp.</h1>

I have definitely grown during my first week of code camp. I have reinforced the syntax of HTML and began to develop my undrestanding of JavaScript syntax. We have downloaded a number of programs and package managers that will assist us with coding, such as: npm, Gulp, Home Brew, and Emmet. We have gained a deeper knowledge of GitHub and the command line.

<h1>Why I joined web developer bootcamp.</h1>

I graduated a bachelor of business administration in 2011, and then a masters of public administration in 2015. Neither degree gave me the gauranteed job security nor marketability that I desired. Web developer bootcamp makes me a more well rounded and desireable professional.

<h1>How to create a branch on GitHub.</h1>

Web developers need tools to access and work on the same projects, without making conflicting changes. GitHub is an excellent tool to accomodate that environment. To create a branch, you simply click on the branch tab. The tab will have a box that says, "Find or create a branch..." Click the box and write desired branch name. Press enter, and your new branch will be created.
